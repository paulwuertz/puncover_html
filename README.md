# Puncover HTML offline

Script to generate an offline HTML version of the [puncover](https://github.com/HBehrens/puncover) project. 
The puncover project allows to generate a website with the relevant information from a binary application (.elf). 
Unfortunately puncover creates a local server and offline access such as report generation is not possible. 

This script creates a local copy of the server running when you execute the puncover script.

## TODOS

- Fix sort row (stack, code).
- Add feature to look for symbols.
